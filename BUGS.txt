mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

Keep aspect ratio during window resize?

Emulator should check version of MAGICLIN.OS to make sure the API fits.

What is XHDI, and shall it be supported? It seems that DFS_FAT.S, the MagiC internal (V)FAT12/16/32
file system driver, supports this to get information about a storage volume.

system info control panel shows 29.12.2003 as kernel build date. Update!

Prevent volume image from being mounted twice.

Eject of host volumes or image should tidy-up something? But what? Filesystem has already been closed before.

Add command line option to convert Atari text files to UTF-8 and vice-versa, including line endings between CR/LF and LF.

Drag & Drop file systems is dumb and treats every file as image, also it only uses A:. If one image is invalid,
not further images can be mounted.


Create disk image:
- 512 bytes per sector
- 2 sectors per cluster
- FAT32
- verbose
- name "FAT32_1M"

dd if=/dev/zero of=vol-fat32-1M.img bs=1M count=1
mkfs.vfat -S 512 -s 2 -F 32 -v -n "FAT32_1M" vol-fat32-1M.img

Modifier keys, especially CapsLock must be re-synchronised after host window change.

Wenn Gembench abstürzt, kommt noch eine gmessage, dann ein Alert vom Atari, und dann geht nichts mehr.
Ist da ein deadlock?
