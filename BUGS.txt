QED file selector does not find files when going from D:\XKAOS\MACXBIOS to D:\XKAOS\.

mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

Keep aspect ratio during window resize?

Emulator should check version of MAGICLIN.OS to make sure the API fits.

hdv_bp() currently cannot be emulated, because it must return a pointer to 68k memory.

What is XHDI, and shall it be supported? It seems that DFS_FAT.S, the MagiC internal (V)FAT12/16/32
file system driver, supports this to get information about a storage volume.

Atari volume images are implemented, but currently do not work for unknown reason. This needs debugging of 68k code.
It seems that getxbpb() in DFS_FAT.S relies on BIOS Getbpb() for FAT16 and FAT12. If this fails, the function
assumes FAT32 and fails for FAT16 or FAT12.
