Drag&Drop of a volume (e.g. floppy disk) image mounts the image only to drive A: or B:.
Maybe it should look for the first free logical drive.

Drag&Drop of a a partitioned disk image mounts only the first not already mounted partition and only to A: or B:.
Maybe it should look for free logical drives and mount all partitions, if possible.

rwabs() does not support physical sector numbers, yet. Maybe that is not really necessary and might be dangerous.

Omicron Basic Compiler 3.06 (crash, and when ejecting "omikron_basic_compiler_3_06_omikron.st", system crashes)

With no VT52.PRG, if starting MCMD, it takes forever until screen gets white,
here nine seconds. Why?

NVDI seems to freeze during start when ASSIGN.SYS is missing?

mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

Keep aspect ratio during window resize?

Emulator should check version of MAGICLIN.OS to make sure the API matches.

What is XHDI, and shall it be supported? It seems that DFS_FAT.S, the MagiC internal (V)FAT12/16/32
file system driver, supports this to get information about a storage volume.

system info control panel shows 29.12.2003 as kernel build date. Update!

Drag & Drop file systems treats every file as image. If one image is invalid, no further images can be mounted.
Maybe provide a list of supported file names extensions (.st, .image, .diskimage).


GEMBENCH crashes (why?) and corrupts the whole emulated system. Why? Is there a deadlock in the emulator?

MGEDIT should be killable via MagiC task manager, but in most time this leads to a total system crash.

The MagiC message "System was overwritten" shall be passed to emulator, if possible.
