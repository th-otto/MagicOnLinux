recursive delete of try leads to crash

mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

Keep aspect ratio during window resize?

Emulator should check version of MAGICLIN.OS to make sure the API fits.

What is XHDI, and shall it be supported? It seems that DFS_FAT.S, the MagiC internal (V)FAT12/16/32
file system driver, supports this to get information about a storage volume.

system info control panel shows 29.12.2003 as kernel build date. Update!

Prevent volume image from being mounted twice.

Add command line option to convert Atari text files to UTF-8 and vice-versa, including line endings between CR/LF and LF.

Drag & Drop file systems treats every file as image. If one image is invalid, no further images can be mounted.
Maybe provide a list of supported file names extensions (.st, .image, .diskimage).

Atari/UTF-8 conversion is multiple times in the source code, for filenames and clipboard.


Create disk image:
- 512 bytes per sector
- 2 sectors per cluster
- FAT32
- verbose
- name "FAT32_1M"

dd if=/dev/zero of=vol-fat32-1M.img bs=1M count=1
mkfs.vfat -S 512 -s 2 -F 32 -v -n "FAT32_1M" vol-fat32-1M.img

GEMBENCH crashes (why?) and corrupts the whole emulated system. Why? Is there a deadlock in the emulator?

MagiC task manager shows artifacts in b/w mode.

MGEDIT should be killable via MagiC task manager, but in most time this leads to a total system crash.

The MagiC message "System was overwritten" shall be passed to emulator.

APPLICATIONS

To test:
- TWORD
- CAB
- Highwire
- Prolist (missing GDOS)

Works:

- Chagall v01.00
- Gempaint 1.3B2
- GSTFRAKT (single-app mode)
- MAPS (8+3 case-insensitive drive)
- Papillon 2.2
- Artworx v1.42 (complains about missing GDOS, needs case-insensitive drive)
- Cypress v1.50
- LDW Power Calc 1.03
- Papyrus 4 (complains about missing fonts, needs case-insensitive drive)
- Papyrus 7 (complains about missing fonts)
- Script (complains about missing fonts, needs case-insensitive drive)
- Script 2 (complains about missing fonts, needs case-insensitive drive)
- Technobox CAD/2 (needs case-insensitive drive)
- Texel 2.10
- Pure C
- RCS28K (patched by Andreas Kromke)
- Getinfo v1.1
- Prgflags
- Intrface v2.29beta
- Kobold?
- Olga?




Works partially:

- DR Doodle (corrupts memory blocks, repairable)
- Logo (corrupts memory blocks, repairable)
- Easydraw (complains about missing GDOS)
- Scigraph (complains about missing GDOS)
- Font Expert, FONTEX.PRG (might run in single application mode)
- Pure Pascal (direct video memory acces, might work with 640x400)
- RSCTEXT (direct video memory acces, might work with 640x400)
- ST-Pascal (direct memory access, then bus error)

Works not:

- CAD 3D
- CAMCAD
- CAMPUS
- SWFŔAK.PRG (system was overwritten)
- PERSYS (draws artifacts like task manager in B/W)
- PLOT_IT.PRG (draws artifacts like task manager in B/W, then crashes)
- STAD_1_3.PRG (accesses video base register, needs case-insensitive drive, freezes system after crash)
- DBASE (why?)
- PHOENIX 4.2 (strange file selector recursion)     <<<=== needs debugging
- SIGNUM2 (trap #9 or memory mapped access to 68881)
- Wordplus (bus error. Why?)
- Wordplus 2 (bus error)
