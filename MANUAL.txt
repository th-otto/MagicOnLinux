Remarks for Usage
=================

The Atari memory size is given in bytes and excludes video memory which is handled separately.
On command line, the size can be specified in kbytes or Mbytes.
This might later change in configuration

Due to a bug in MVDI and NVDI, the VT52 emulator draws graphics artifacts e.g. with CLR SCREEN,
visible in the MagiC task manager or if VT52.PRG is missing, when the screen width and
height are not dividable by the system character size (8x8 or 8x16).
To avoid this effect, the geometry is adjusted accordingly.

With no VT52.PRG, if starting a TOS program like MCMD, it takes forever until screen gets white.
This results from the MagiC kernel which used to work with slow floppy disk drives.


Graphic Modes
=============

MVDI (MagiC VDI) is a stripped and slower sibling of NVDI, by the Behne Brothers.
These are the provided (M)VDI drivers:

- *.OSD are offscreen drivers and not hardware related
- *.NOD come from NVDI, they are faster than their OSD pendants.
  They are preferably loaded during boot process if they are found.
- MFA*.SYS are Atari hardware related and not used by MagicOnLinux or predecessors.
- MFM*.SYS are used by MagicOnLinux.
- NFM*.SYS come from NVDI, they are faster than their MFM pendants.
  They are not automatically loaded during boot, as the internal VDI
  explicitly opens e.g. MFM2.SYS in monochrome mode.
  It also seems that they are incompatible.

In particular:

- MFM2.SYS/NFM2.SYS:    monochrome mode (black/white)
- MFM4IP.SYS:           4 colours in 2 interleaved planes
- MFM16.SYS:            16 colours in 4 consecutive (?) planes
- MFM16IP.SYS:          16 colours in 4 interlaved planes
- MFM16M.SYS:           16 mio colours, 32-bit pixel packed, 24 from which are used
- MFM32K.SYS:           32768 colours, 16-bit pixel packed
- MFM256.SYS:           256 colours, 8-bit pixel packed

Note that the 16M and 32K graphics formats are direct, i.e. no colour palettes.
All other modes are indirect, with a colour palette of different length.

Note that 16M is recommended for MagicOnLinux. It is similar to the host
graphics format and thus leads to the best performance. Also the 256-colour
and monochrome modes are fast, because the colour representation is
suitable for the 68k emulation.

The IP formats are impractical for any kind of software and thus
are relatively slow. Maybe they are useful for specific Atari software.


Limitations
===========

Atari RAM size is limited to 2 GB. No idea, if such large RAM would make any sense.

In virtual drive U: the symbolic links are not updated when virtual drives are ejected or added.
This is a limitation or design flaw of the MagiC kernel, to be more precise: "DFS_U.S".

Currently MagicOnLinux mounts FAT volume images only, i.e. no partitioned images.
Volumes with MBR partitions may be supported later. AHDI seems not to use MBR, but a proprietary
format. As there are no AHDI disk images lying around, a support would be unnecessary.

MagicOnLinux mounts floppy images in format ".st" (which is just a usual image), but
neither .stx nor .msa.

In Ubuntu, most disk or volume images can be activated just by double-click. Note that the
"gnome-disk-image-mounter" must be run from command line with parameter "-w" or "--writable" to make the image writable.
However, it seems that at least not all ".st" images are accepted, maybe because of some details
in the boot sector that are not fully MS-DOS conformant.

The .msa format (Magic Shadow Archiver) shall preserve copy-protection information. It can be converted
using "tools/hmsa" in the Hatari source directory (obviously by losing copy-protection data).
A standlone version can be found here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20060507110406/https://www.uni-ulm.de/~s_thuth/ix/msa-0.1.0.tar.gz

The .stx format also contains raw floppy disk data, to preserve copy-protection. It can be
read with Hatari. Hatari conveniently mounts host directories, so that files can be
easily copied from .stx or .msa as A: to a virtual drive C:.


This and That
=============

NVDI seems to freeze during start when ASSIGN.SYS is missing.

Thanks to Thorsten Otto for the DFS_FAT FAT32 endianess bugfix (meta data on disk are always little-endian).


Create Volume images
====================

Consider we want to create a disk image of these dimensions:

- 512 bytes per sector
- 2 sectors per cluster
- FAT32
- verbose
- name "FAT32_1M"

Then these commands can be used:

dd if=/dev/zero of=vol-fat32-1M.img bs=1M count=1
mkfs.vfat -S 512 -s 2 -F 32 -v -n "FAT32_1M" vol-fat32-1M.img

Note that README.md lists an alternative solution that works without preceding "dd".
