Due to the XFS concept there is a host handle leak which can only be solved by changing
the Atari part of the Host XFS. Note that the MacOS/Carbon based XFS only stored
volume-ID (2 bytes) and file-ID (4 bytes) to the internal descriptor, without
opening directory or file. This concept is not suitable for Linux/Unix.

mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

In MagicMacX kernel, the floppy and hard drive functions unfortunately are all dummies:

hdv_init
hdv_rw
hdv_bp
hdv_mediach
hdv_boot

(see KERNEL/BIOS/MAGXMACX/DRIVE.S)

This should be replaced by a concept like XFS:

hdv_rw_host:
 ....
 moveq    #opcode, d0
 lea      MSysX+MacSysX_rawdrvr,a0
 MACPPCE
 lea      ...(sp),sp
 rts

For this, the MagicMacX kernel must be recompiled, which needs a workable Atari toolchain.
