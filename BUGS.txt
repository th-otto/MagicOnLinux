mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

Keep aspect ratio during window resize?

In MagicMacX kernel, the floppy and hard drive functions unfortunately are all dummies:

hdv_init
hdv_rw
hdv_bp
hdv_mediach
hdv_boot

(see KERNEL/BIOS/MAGXMACX/DRIVE.S)

This should be replaced by a concept like XFS:

hdv_rw_host:
 ....
 moveq    #opcode, d0
 lea      MSysX+MacSysX_rawdrvr,a0
 MACPPCE
 lea      ...(sp),sp
 rts
