mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

Keep aspect ratio during window resize?

Emulator should check version of MAGICLIN.OS to make sure the API fits.

In MagicMacX kernel, the floppy and hard drive functions unfortunately are all dummies:

hdv_init
hdv_rw
hdv_bp
hdv_mediach
hdv_boot

(see KERNEL/BIOS/MAGXMACX/DRIVE.S)

This should be replaced by a concept like XFS:

hdv_rw_host:
 ....
 moveq    #opcode, d0
 lea      MSysX+MacSysX_rawdrvr,a0
 MACPPCE
 lea      ...(sp),sp
 rts

What is XHDI, and shall it be supported? It seems that DFS_FAT.S, the MagiC internal (V)FAT12/16/32
file system driver, supports this to get information about a storage volume.
