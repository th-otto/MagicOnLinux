mcmd shows "0 bytes free"

Keep aspect ratio during window resize?

Emulator should check version of MAGICLIN.OS to make sure the API fits.

What is XHDI, and shall it be supported? It seems that DFS_FAT.S, the MagiC internal (V)FAT12/16/32
file system driver, supports this to get information about a storage volume.

system info control panel shows 29.12.2003 as kernel build date. Update!

Prevent volume image from being mounted twice.

Add command line option to convert Atari text files to UTF-8 and vice-versa, including line endings between CR/LF and LF.

Drag & Drop file systems treats every file as image. If one image is invalid, no further images can be mounted.
Maybe provide a list of supported file names extensions (.st, .image, .diskimage).

Atari/UTF-8 conversion is multiple times in the source code, for filenames and clipboard.


Create disk image:
- 512 bytes per sector
- 2 sectors per cluster
- FAT32
- verbose
- name "FAT32_1M"

dd if=/dev/zero of=vol-fat32-1M.img bs=1M count=1
mkfs.vfat -S 512 -s 2 -F 32 -v -n "FAT32_1M" vol-fat32-1M.img

GEMBENCH crashes (why?) and corrupts the whole emulated system. Why? Is there a deadlock in the emulator?

MGEDIT should be killable via MagiC task manager, but in most time this leads to a total system crash.
